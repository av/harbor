⚠️ This module is only compatible with Open WebUI as a client due to its support of custom artifacts.

When serving the completion, LLM will first invent a skill check it must pass to address your message. Then, the workflow will roll a dice determining if the model passes the check or not and will guide the model to respond accordingly.

<instruction>
Read the "message" carefully and thoroughly.
Now, as a game master you will think of a skill check the player must pass to address that message.
The check name is a few words long and closely related to the message, it's specific.
Take your first option - throw it away, it's too generic and shallow.
Take your second option - throw it away, it's trying too hard to be clever.
Proceed throwing options away until you have a skill name that just "perfect".
Now, pinch a tiny bit of sarcasm on top - that's the one.
Reply with the skill name and nothing else.
