An extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the
Jupyter Notebook and Architecture.

#### Starting

```bash
# [Optional] pre-build the image
harbor build jupyter

# Start the service
harbor up jupyter

# Open JupyterLab in the browser
harbor open jupyter
```

#### Configuration

Your notebooks are stored in the Harbor workspace, under the `jupyter` directory.

```bash
# Opens workspace folder in the File Manager
harbor jupyter workspace

# See workspace location,
# relative to $(harbor home)
harbor config get jupyter.workspace
```

Additionally, you can configure service to install additional packages.

```bash
# See deps help
# It's a manager for underlying array
harbor jupyter deps -h

# Add packages to install, supports the same
# specifier syntax as pip
harbor jupyter deps add numpy
harbor jupyter deps add SomeProject@git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git@1.3.1
harbor jupyter deps add SomePackage[PDF,EPUB]==3.1.4

# Rebuilt the service image for dependencies
# to become available
harbor down
harbor build jupyter
harbor up jupyter
```

Apart from that, following options can be set via [`harbor config`](./3.-Harbor-CLI-Reference.md#harbor-config):

```bash
# The port on the host where JupyterLab will be available
JUPYTER_HOST_PORT              34101

# Image to use as a base for JupyterLab service
# Two requirements: have python and pip installed,
# can be any such image
JUPYTER_IMAGE                  pytorch/pytorch:2.3.0-cuda12.1-cudnn8-runtime

# Location of the JupyterLab workspace on the host
# This is where service data is stored
# Should be either relative to $(harbor home) or an absolute path
JUPYTER_WORKSPACE              ./jupyter/workspace

# Extra dependencies to install in JupyterLab image
# semicolon-separated, will use pip to install them (so can use pip version specifiers)
JUPYTER_EXTRA_DEPS             transformers;accelerate;lm_eval;matplotlib;numpy
```
