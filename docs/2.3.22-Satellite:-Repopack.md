Repopack is a powerful tool that packs your entire repository into a single, AI-friendly file.
Perfect for when you need to feed your codebase to Large Language Models (LLMs) or other AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini.

#### Starting

```bash
# [Optional] Pre-build the image
harbor build repopack

# Run the CLI
harbor repopack --help
```

#### Usage

`repopack` is intended to be used at a specific repository folder. Harbor mounts current `$PWD` to the CLI, it means that you can only use nested paths from the current directory, but not the parent ones.

```bash
# Example: pack the Harbor repo
cd $(harbor home)
harbor repopack -o harbor.repo --style xml
```

#### Configuration

This satellite doesn't run LLMs or other AI tools, so it doesn't require any specific configuration.
