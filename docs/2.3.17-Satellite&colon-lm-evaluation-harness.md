#### Overview

This project provides a unified framework to test generative language models on a large number of different evaluation tasks.

#### Starting

```bash
# [Optional] pre-build the image
harbor build lmeval
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use either `lmeval` or `lm_eval` alias for invoking the service. These docs will use `lmeval`.

```bash
# [Optional] see the help
harbor lmeval --help

# [Optional] see available tasks
harbor lmeval --tasks list
```

After the configuration is complete (see below), run evals with:

```bash
harbor lmeval --tasks gsm8k --limit 10
```

#### Configuration

Harbor's `lmeval` service is mainly intended to be run against OpenAI-compatible APIs, rather than running models on its own, although the latter is also possible.

In other words, the workflows are optimised for running `lm_eval` with the `--model local-completions`, which is also the default.

```bash
# local-completions is the default
# See other supported "types":
# https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/README.md#model-apis-and-inference-servers
harbor lmeval type

# Get/set the model and the API url
harbor lmeval model
harbor lmeval model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
harbor lmeval api
harbor lmeval api $(harbor url -i vllm)
```

> [!TIP]
> `harbor url` works when a given service is running, `-i` is for retrieving the URL to be used within the service containers.

Above commands are aliases for the `harbor lmeval args get/set model/base_url` respectively. You can manage the rest of the `--model_args` in a dictionary format as follows:

```bash
# See the help on working with dict args
harbor lmeval args -h

# See current args
harbor lmeval args ls
harbor lmeval args

# Get arg value
harbor lmeval args get model

# Set arg value
harbor lmeval args set model $(harbor vllm model)
```

Here is a list of sample args from the official docs:

```bash
# "model" is the model ID that is sent to the API
harbor lmeval args set model llama3.1:8b

# "base_url" is the URL of the API, from _within_
# the container, use "harbor url -i" to get it
harbor lmeval args set base_url $(harbor url -i ollama)

# "num_concurrent" is the number of concurrent
# requests to make to the completion API
harbor lmeval args set num_concurrent 4

# "tokenized_requests" is a boolean flag that
harbor lmeval args set tokenized_requests False

# "tokenizer" is the name of the tokenizer to use
harbor lmeval args set tokenizer gpt2
```

Harbor connects cache and results folders from your host to the `lmeval`:

```bash
# Open cache folder in the file manager
harbor lmeval cache
# Open results folder in the file manager
harbor lmeval results
```

By default, the results and cache will be specific for every distinct `harbor lmeval model` you set.

##### Ollama example

> [!NOTE]
> When running with `ollama`, `llamacpp` and other services that do not use HuggingFace repo specifier (user/model), you'll need to manually point `lmeval` to use the correct tokenizer. Most typically, you can use an official repo of the base model as a tokenizer specifier.

```bash
# Start ollama
harbor up
# Pick the model to test
harbor ollama ls
# Configure lmeval
harbor lmeval model llama3.1:8b
harbor lmeval api $(harbor url -i ollama)/v1/completions
harbor lmeval args tokenizer set meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct

# Run the eval
harbor lmeval --tasks gsm8k --limit 10
```

##### llama.cpp example

```bash
# Start with llamacpp
harbor up llamacpp
# Pick the model to test
curl -s $(harbor url llamacpp)/v1/models | jq -r '.data[].id'

# Configure lmeval
harbor lmeval model <model id>
harbor lmeval api $(harbor url -i llamacpp)/v1/completions
harbor lmeval args tokenizer set <hf repo id>

# Run the eval
harbor lmeval --tasks gsm8k --limit 10
```
