# Landing

Harbor's static landing page service provides a welcoming, informative entry point to the Harbor project. It showcases Harbor's value proposition, features, quick start guide, and hosts the complete project documentation.

## Overview

The landing page is a lightweight, static website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, served by nginx. It's designed to be fast, accessible, and provide an overview of Harbor's capabilities before users dive into the full documentation.

## Quick Start

Start the landing page:

```bash
harbor up landing
```

Access the landing page:

```bash
harbor open landing
# Or visit http://localhost:33800
```

## Features

The landing page includes:

- **Hero Section**: Clear value proposition and quick command examples
- **Features Showcase**: 12 key features with visual icons and code samples
- **Quick Start Guide**: Three-step installation and setup process
- **Services Overview**: Display of 100+ integrated services organized by category
- **Static Documentation**: Complete Harbor documentation accessible at `/docs/`
- **Community Links**: Easy access to GitHub, Discord, and other resources

## Configuration

### Port Configuration

Change the landing page port:

```bash
harbor config set landing.host.port 8080
```

Or edit in `.env`:

```bash
HARBOR_LANDING_HOST_PORT=8080
```

### Documentation

The landing page automatically serves the documentation from the `docs/` directory at the `/docs/` path. All markdown files and images in the docs folder are accessible through the web interface.

## Architecture

The landing service uses:

- **Web Server**: nginx:alpine (lightweight, ~10MB image)
- **Content**: Static HTML/CSS served from `landing/www/`
- **Documentation**: Read-only mount of `docs/` directory
- **Configuration**: Custom nginx config for proper routing

## Development

To modify the landing page:

1. Edit files in `landing/www/`:
   - `index.html` - Main page structure
   - `style.css` - Styling and responsive design

2. Restart the service to see changes:
   ```bash
   harbor restart landing
   ```

The nginx configuration (`landing/nginx.conf`) handles:
- Static file serving with caching
- Documentation routing at `/docs/`
- Gzip compression for better performance
- Proper MIME types and directory indexing

## Use Cases

- **Project Introduction**: Give newcomers a quick overview of Harbor
- **Feature Discovery**: Help users understand what Harbor can do
- **Quick Reference**: Access documentation without leaving the local environment
- **Offline Access**: Full documentation available when offline

## Technical Details

- **Container**: nginx:alpine
- **Default Port**: 33800
- **Health Check**: HTTP GET on port 80
- **Volumes**:
  - `./landing/www` → `/usr/share/nginx/html` (read-only)
  - `./docs` → `/docs` (read-only)
  - `./landing/nginx.conf` → `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` (read-only)

## Tips

- The landing page is designed to work without JavaScript for maximum compatibility
- All documentation links use relative paths for offline access
- The page is fully responsive and works on mobile devices
- No external dependencies or CDN resources are required
