### [cmdh](https://github.com/pgibler/cmdh)

> Handle: `cmdh`
> URL: -

#### Starting

```bash
# [Optional] Pre-build the service image
harbor build cmdh
```

#### Overview

`cmdh` is a CLI-only service that tries to generate a bash command from your input. You don't need to start it, as it's a CLI tool.

Be advised that it works best with larger models. Expect acceptable results from `codestral` and above.

> [!NOTE]
> Harbor runs patched version of `cmdh` that uses Ollama json format and has a slightly tweaked system prompt.

#### Usage

```bash
# Invoke "harbor cmdh" and then type in
# your command, no quotes needed
harbor cmdh how many CPU cores do I have?
```

Harbor mounts `$PWD` to the service, so it can work with it directly. The `$PWD` will match those of a host, but be aware that only the children directories and files are actually available.

```bash
# Go where you'd run the command
user@os:~/.cache/huggingface$ ▼ harbor cmdh find all the ggufs here

# Example output:
✔ Retrieving command... find all the ggufs here
desired command: find / -type f -name "*.gguf"
assistant message: The 'find' command is a powerful utility that searches for files and directories in a specified path. In this case, it will search the entire file system from root (/) for any files with the extension '.gguf'. The options used ensure that only regular files are considered, not directories or other types of files.

Running: find / -type f -name "*.gguf"

```

#### Configuration

##### Ollama

You should select a model for the `cmdh` to use.

```bash
# Set cmdh to use ollama (if not already set)
harbor cmdh host ollama

# See what's currently available
harbor ollama list

# See currently configured model
harbor cmdh model

# Set the model to run
harbor cmdh model codestral
```

##### OpenAI

`cmdh` should also work with OpenAI-compatible APIs.

```bash
# Note the casing - required by library
harbor cmdh host OpenAI

# Point cmdh to OpenAI API
harbor cmdh key <key>
harbor cmdh url <url>

# Set the model to run
harbor cmdh model gpt-3.5-turbo
```
