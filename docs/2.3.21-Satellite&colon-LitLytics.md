#### Starting

```bash
# [Optional] Pre-pull the litlytics image
# otherwise will be pulled on start
harbor pull litlytics

# Start the service
harbor up litlytics

# [Optional] once started, open the UI
# in your default browser
harbor open litlytics
```

#### Configuration

Unfortunately there's no way to pre-configure LitLytics in any way otherwise than via the provided UI.

You can obtain needed configuration options via Harbor CLI, for example for `ollama`:

```bash
# Launch with Ollama and WebUI
harbor up litlytics

# Find and copy the Model ID
harbor ollama ls | grep qwen2.5

# Grab URL for LitLytics to connect to Ollama
harbor url ollama
```
