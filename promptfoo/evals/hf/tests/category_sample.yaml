      What makes a piece of material to be learnedmeaningful, andhow does its
      meaningfulness affect the rate of learning?


      Options:

      A) Meaningfulness is determined solely by the difficulty of the material,
      not by associations

      B) The rate of learning is unaffected by the meaningfulness of the
      material

      C) Learning is easier when the material is unfamiliar

      D) Learning is facilitated when the material is abstract and theoretical
      with no practical applications

      E) The more sensory modalities involved in presenting the material, the
      less meaningful it becomes

      F) Learning is more effective when the material has no relevance to the
      learner's prior knowledge or experiences

      G) The more meaningful something is, the easier it is to learn and retain
      it. Meaningfulness is measured by the number of associations they evoked.

      H) Learning is faster when there are fewer associations

      I) The more complex the material, the easier it is to learn

      J) Material is considered meaningful if it is presented in a larger
      volume, regardless of associations

      This question refers to the following information.

      Read the the following poem to answer questions.

      Take up the White Man's burden—

      Send forth the best ye breed—

      Go bind your sons to exile

      To serve your captives' need;

      To wait in heavy harness,

      On fluttered folk and wild—

      Your new-caught, sullen peoples,

      Half-devil and half-child.

      ...

      Take up the White Man's burden—

      The savage wars of peace—

      Fill full the mouth of Famine

      And bid the sickness cease;

      And when your goal is nearest

      The end for others sought…

      Watch sloth and heathen Folly

      Bring all your hopes to naught.

      Rudyard Kipling, The White Man's Burden, 1899

      It is generally acknowledged that Kipling fashioned White Man's Burden to
      address the subject of the American colonization of the Philippines, which
      the United States had recently won from Spain in the Spanish-American War.
      With that information in mind, what message can Kipling be said to be
      offering the Americans in this excerpt?


      Options:

      A) A call for all Western nations to unite in the effort of colonization

      B) A critique of the American government for engaging in the act of
      colonization

      C) An appeal to respect the cultural differences and practices of
      colonized peoples

      D) An exhortation to Christianize the heathen peoples of the world

      E) A warning to avoid the war and hardships of imperialism

      F) An endorsement of the use of force and military might in colonization

      G) A plea to the Americans to return the colonized peoples to their
      homelands

      H) An encouragement to Americans to seize the economic opportunities
      offered by the colonies

      I) A reminder of the responsibility of advanced civilizations to bring the
      benefits of modern civilization to less-developed peoples

      J) An ironic presentation of the sheer folly of imperialism

      A buyer filed a lawsuit against a seller based on a written contract
      allegedly executed at the time of the sale of the seller's hot dog stand
      to the buyer. Under the terms of the contract, the seller agreed not to
      open a hot dog stand for a period of two years within a distance of two
      miles of the old hot dog stand, now owned by the buyer. The buyer alleged
      in his complaint that the seller violated the contract by opening a hot
      dog stand one-half mile from the old location. The original contract was
      lost prior to trial. At trial, the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate
      carbon copy of the written contract. The seller objects as to the
      authenticity of the original written contract. The copy is

      A) inadmissible, because the seller contests the authenticity of the
