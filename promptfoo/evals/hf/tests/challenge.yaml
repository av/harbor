    question: >-
      A man filed a federal diversity action against a bus company, seeking
      damages for injuries he had sustained in an accident while riding a bus
      owned by the company. The man demanded a jury trial. After the parties'
      attorneys examined the prospective jurors and exercised their challenges,
      six jurors and two alternate jurors were chosen. During the trial, two
      jurors became ill and were replaced by the alternate jurors. At the
      conclusion of replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of the
      trial, a third juror also became ill, and the court excused that juror.
      The parties' attorneys stipulated to the return of a verdict from a
      five-person jury. The jury then deliberated and returned a verdict for the
      company. The man timely filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the
      five-person jury was not large enough to return a verdict. Should the
      court grant the motion?


      Options:

      A) No, because the verdict was reached before the third juror was excused.

      B) No, because the court properly excused the three jurors due to illness.

      C) Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.

      D) Yes, because there must be at least 12 jurors on a federal civil jury.

      E) Yes, because the replacement of jurors during the trial invalidated the
      verdict.

      F) Yes, because the stipulation of the attorneys cannot override federal
      jury size requirements.

      G) No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer
      than six jurors.

      H) No, because the illness of jurors is a valid reason for reducing the
      jury size.

      I) No, because the remaining jurors were sufficient to reach a unanimous
      decision.

      J) Yes, because the man was not given a fair trial due to the reduced jury
      size.

      Vitamin D deficiency can often be found as a single nutrient deficiency,
      that is, in an otherwise well-nourished person. The main reason this can
      happen is because:



      Options:

      A) Vitamin D is not essential for the body, therefore, its deficiency
      doesn't affect the overall nourishment.

      B) Vitamin D is a rare nutrient and can only be found in a few expensive
      food items.

      C) Vitamin D absorption is not affected by the presence of other nutrients
      in the body.

      D) The content of vitamin D in foods depends on the soil in which the food
      was grown so is not related to wealth or age.

      E) Overconsumption of Vitamin D can lead to its deficiency.

      F) Diets containing sufficient other nutrients to promote growth can
      increase the requirement of vitamin D so that it becomes limiting.

      G) Most vitamin D in the body does not come from food so access to food is
      not an important determinant of vitamin D status.

      H) Foods containing large amounts of vitamin D are eaten by both poor and
      wealthy people according to various cultural reasons.

      I) Vitamin D is present in all types of food, therefore, its deficiency is
      usually accompanied by other nutrient deficiencies.

      J) Vitamin D is only produced in the body during certain times of the
      year.
