      You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes

      You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of
      double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these

      start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to
      anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene
      products?

      After tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where
      100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of
      the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0%

      All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except





      (A) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5`
      end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery
      nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal
      frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed
      ribosomal frameshifting.

      (B) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the
      number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and
      SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when
      under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable
      frameshifting rates.

      (C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8
      activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2.
      Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the
      extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a
      crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that
      the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the
      extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

      (D) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch
      repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10
      making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.

      Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two

      host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both

      You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:

      You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the
      neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their
      interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight
      alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that
      create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two
      alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF
      at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and
      fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter,
      and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the
      ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and
      between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the
      lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the

      Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO
      spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the
      Keck Observatory? Please refer to the links below for more information
      about the observatories. It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with
      apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with
      HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. For the sake of
      simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as
      maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the
      telescopes.

      α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double
      bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with
      nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile
      attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate.
      When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is
      known as the Michael reaction.

      While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope
      operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum
      pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample
      compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved
      electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained
      inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike
      accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the
      vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample
      compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating
      the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean
      free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found
      that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even
      though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.

      of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in
      that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance,
      r)?

      Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take
      spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2
      +S1S3+S2S3 ].

      Find the partition function Z of the system. (\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann
      constant and T= temperature)

      Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a
      circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that
      has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period
      of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a
      radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit
      both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also
      has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously
      mentioned transiting planet.


      (A) ~ 7.5

      (B) ~ 33.5

      (C) ~ 37.5
