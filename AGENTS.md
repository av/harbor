You will not confuse this project with the Harbor container registry. This is a different project with the same name.
Harbor is a containerized LLM toolkit that allows you to run LLMs and additional services. It consists of a CLI and a companion App that allows you to manage and run AI services with ease.
Harbor is in essence a very large Docker Compose project with extra conventions and tools for managing it.
When adding new service, read [instructions for adding new service](./.github/copilot-new-service.md).
When user shows you a new or not obvious command for you - document it in this AGENTS.md file.

Important locations:
- '.' - root, also referred to as `$(harbor home)`
- `harbor.sh` - the main CLI script, it is very large and complex, but it contains the main entry point for the CLI
- `/app` - the Tauri app that provides a GUI for managing services
- `/docs` - documentation for the project and services
- `/routines` - part of the CLI that was rewritten in Deno
- `/.scripts` - scripts for development tasks, written in Deno and Bash

The CLI is already installed globally for your tests, you may run `harbor <command>` directly.

```bash
harbor help
harbor build <service>
harbor logs <service> # tails by default
# Raw compose command for the service
$(harbor cmd <service>)
```

Refer to [CLI Reference](./docs/3.-Harbor-CLI-Reference.md) for more details.

# harbor.yaml - Service Configuration (WIP)

## Overview

Harbor is evolving to support a unified **`harbor.yaml`** configuration file per service. This enables:
- Using **stock Docker Compose files** from upstream projects with zero modifications
- Declarative service metadata for the Harbor App
- Simplified config merging via init containers

This approach maintains **full backward compatibility** - existing services without `harbor.yaml` work exactly as before.

## File Structure

```
harbor/
  {service}/
    harbor.yaml                   # Service configuration (NEW)
    upstream/                     # Git submodule or copy of upstream repo
      docker-compose.yaml         # UNTOUCHED stock file
    override.env                  # Harbor env overrides
  compose.{service}.yml           # Harbor overlay (cross-service integration)
```

## `harbor.yaml` Schema

```yaml
# Upstream compose transformation (optional)
# Use this when integrating stock Docker Compose files
upstream:
  # Path to stock compose file (relative to service directory)
  source: ./upstream/docker/docker-compose.yaml

  # Prefix for all service names (api -> dify2-api)
  prefix: dify2

  # Services to include (default: all)
  include:
    - api
    - worker
    - web

  # Services to exclude
  exclude:
    - nginx

  # Init container for config preparation (optional)
  init:
    image: python:3.11-alpine
    script: ./scripts/prepare-config.sh
    volumes:
      - ./configs:/input
      - {prefix}-shared:/output

# Service metadata for Harbor App (future)
metadata:
  tags: [backend, api]
  wikiUrl: https://github.com/av/harbor/wiki/myservice

# Config merging (future)
configs:
  base: ./configs/config.yml
  cross:
    ollama: ./configs/config.ollama.yml
```

## Upstream Transformation Rules

When `upstream:` is specified, the CLI automatically transforms the stock compose:

| Original | Transformed |
|----------|-------------|
| Service `api` | `{prefix}-api` |
| `container_name: X` | `${HARBOR_CONTAINER_PREFIX}.{prefix}-{original}` |
| `depends_on: [redis]` | `depends_on: [{prefix}-redis]` |
| `network_mode: service:X` | `network_mode: service:{prefix}-X` |
| Volume `mydata` | `{prefix}-mydata` |
| Networks | Add `harbor-network` to all services |
| `env_file` | Inject `.env` and `override.env` |

## Migration Path

Existing services can be gradually migrated:

1. **No change needed** - Services without `harbor.yaml` work as before
2. **Add harbor.yaml** - For new services using stock compose files
3. **Migrate existing** - Replace manually-rewritten compose with `upstream:` config

## Implementation Status

See [Progress.md](./Progress.md) for current development status.

## Stock Compose Compatibility Matrix

| Project | Services | Complexity | Status |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|
| Dify | 10+ | High (YAML anchors, init container) | 🔄 In Progress |
| Langflow | 2 | Low | ⏳ Planned |
| Open-WebUI | 2 | Low | ⏳ Planned |
| Flowise | 1 | Low | ⏳ Planned |
| Lobe-Chat | 7+ | High (network_mode) | ⏳ Planned |
